# Bilkent_University_CS_464_Projects

CS 464 is an introductory course to machine learning. The homeworks of this course were focused on different aspects of machine learning. They include mathematical questions along computer assignments to be solved in matlab. My solutions for both the written and coding questions are given in this repository.

Each folder includes one of the homeworks. For each homework, the "Questions" and the homework "Report" are given in pdf files. The MATLAB code used for the computer assignments is also provided, along with a readme for each homework.
