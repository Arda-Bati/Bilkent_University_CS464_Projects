My report can be found in the report.pdf file.

The results of the questions (codes, command line outputs, plots) 
can be found in the corresponding pfd files.  

I wrote my codes in MATLAB. They are currently in the codes folder as .m files. 
For Q2A, Q2C and Q3 there are three seperate .m codes, hw3_q2a, hw3_q2c, hw3_q3.

Each code can run seperately with the following commands in the MATLAB command line:

hw3_q2a(path)
hw3_q2c(path)
hw3_q3(path)

where path is the folder in which the clustering.csv and digits.csv files are located.
Warning: The path name shouldn't contain the file name (for example clustering.csv), 
my code adds it on its own.

For example I used

path = 'C:\Users\User\Desktop\MLHW3\hw3_data'

hw3_data folder included the clustering.csv and digits.csv files.

After the scripts run, the relevant results are printed to the MATLAB's command line
and relevant plots are drawn.

Note: I used MATLAB R2016b to run the code.
